## Introduction
Most Probable Next Word(s) Predictor

**Objective:** Predicting the next word based on user-input ngrams (sequence of words). 

**Internal Structure:** The prediction uses a curated corpus from Blogs, Twitter, and News sources provided by the John Hopkins University Data Science instructors at Coursera. 
The Prediction Model was trained on a combined randomly selected 10% sample from each corpus, totaling approximately 55.62 MB. 

Accuracy was checked on unseen vector of testing data and found to be reasonable.


## Neurology

**Method:** Markov Model Approach

For input ngram of up to five words (n=5 or less), it predicts the next most probable words. 

If a word can't be predicted using a five-word context for a 5-gram, it performs a line search using contexts of decreasing length (n = 4, 3, 2, 1) by truncating tails until the best result is found. 

If no suitable prediction is found up to the n=1 stage, it defaults to the most frequent words in the training set. 

For inputs longer than five words (n >= 5), it considers only the last five words for prediction and continues with line search of the next word as in the case of n=5.
